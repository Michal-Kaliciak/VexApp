				VEX is not like the typical debt collection company operating in Poland.<br>
				We are the new Cyber-debt collectors or Cyber- Trackers.
			</p><p>
				We don’t promise what everybody else does.<br> 
				We model our effectiveness by processing the needs of specific debtors and existing situations.  
			</p><p>
				In meetings we don’t only listen but we hear the debtors,<br>
				We hear their history,<br>
				We listen to their opinion<br>
				What is important for them,<br>
				What makes their situation difficult, <br>
				Their dreams and their struggle to fulfill it,<br>
				It’s important to know the person, not just as another case. 
			</p><p>
				Regardless to our effectiveness our business partners will have full access to the Cyber-Tracking operation.  
			</p><p>
				Do not hesitate to contact us today, we are here to help and guide you ...<br>
