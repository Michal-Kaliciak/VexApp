		   		WE HAVE THE REPUTATION OF PROFESSIONAL DEBT COLLECTORS, WE WORK FOR THE LARGEST DEBT COLLECTION COMPANIES IN POLAND! THE PRINCIPLE IS SIMPLE - OTHERS BUY DEBTORS PACKAGES AND HIRED US TO DEAL WITH DIFFICULT DEBTORS. WE ARE TRACKING THOSE WHO ARE HIDING FROM THEM, AS WELL AS THE CREDITORS AND THEIR BAILIFFS.
			</p><p style="font-style: italic;">
				They talk about us being the best because we work for other debt collection companies. But that's just one reason ...
			</p><p>
				The secondary creditor is as important as the primary creditor. This is why VEX is the first company in Poland that is focusing on debt recovery for secondary creditors!
			</p><p>
				We understand that in today's time, the amount of secondary debt owed by a creditor can be as large and in some cases simply greater than that of a primary creditor. Buyers of large debt portfolios over time begin to struggle with the same resources and cost issues as the largest banks - leverage their own structures or outsource?
			</p><p>
				VEX is a specialized and unique operating unit in the debt collection market in Poland.	We specialize in the debt collection of hard debtors, as well as in tracking (also cybernetic) hiding debtors - our business partners always give us the opportunity to focus on the contactable part of the package purchased and we ourselves reach the debtors.
			</p><p>
				What are the other debts with which we are dealing here at VEX?
			</p><p>
				Unsuccessful bailiffs, both primary and secondary creditors, this also applies to old bank bundles or credit unions, which have loans that have been granted after 1995.
			</p><p>
				Where other debt collection companies have failed to succeed, we at VEX have been able to exceed customers expectation by showing positive results. 
			</p><p>
				Preferred debtors: consumers and business.
			</p><p>
				We do not throw words in the wind. We are only counting on the chance to prove ourselves.
			</p><p>
				Our customers is usually testing us by choosing the most difficult clients for us in order to test our ability, but after three months of receiving positive results they decide to give us full cooperation.
			</p><p>

				Markus Marcinkiewicz
